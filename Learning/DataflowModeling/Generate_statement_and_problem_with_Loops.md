- `Generate statement` is used for creating loops in concurrent assignments. These loops are very different from software loops.
- Suppose `for i = 1 to N’ is a loop`, then, in software ‘i’ will be assigned one value at a time i.e. first `i=1`, then next cycle `i=2` and so on.
- Whereas in VHDL, N logic will be implement for this loop, which will execute in parallel. Also, in software, ‘N’ cycles are required to complete the loop, whereas in VHDL the loop will execute in one cycle.
